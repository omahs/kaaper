## ❓ Reference 

Kaaper, also commonly known as Sheikh el-Beled, was an ancient Egyptian scribe and priest who lived between the late 4th Dynasty and the early 5th Dynasty (around 2500 BCE).

The job of a scribe was to record in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt.

A documentation generator has pretty much the same duties as a scribe, right?
